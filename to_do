For the Prism spectra: 

                - Resample the SDSS to PRISM resolution
                - download all the spectral products of SDSS
                - Download the high z spectra
                - Stack both the spectra with padding
                - Bin it and make a measure on variation of continuum ignoring strong emission lines

For a Grism spectra:

                - resample the SDSS to grism? or the other way aroud?
                - bin the SDSS spectral redshift range
                - 



Restart:
                - Fit the catalogue of different AGN types
                - AGN+free pee galaxies with Laura
                - Do the fitting together of the green pee
                - Hopefully Seyfert is lowest chi-square then Fit the Seyfert population to LRD population to see which subclass wins. Perhaps add Green Pee too
                - Gaussian+Gaussian , Gausianxexponential+Gausian, single gaussian to the fits of the emission line of the AGN seyfert
